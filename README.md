<h1>Favicon PHP class</h1>

<p>
	With the Favicon class you can get a favicon image by a given URL. Favicon receives the image from the Google service and stores it in
	a local database in form of a Base64 code.
</p>

<h2>Why not use the Google service directly?</h2>

<p>
	If you want to get lots of favicon images it could take a long time to request the service for each URL.<br>
	Instead with this class the favicon stays cached in your database.
